# WAL Service - Complete Kubernetes Deployment Solution

## 🎯 Overview

This repository now includes a **complete, production-ready Kubernetes deployment solution** for the WAL Service with comprehensive automation scripts and best practices.

## ✅ What's Included

### 🏗️ Complete Kubernetes Configuration
- **Base Resources**: Deployments, Services, Ingress, ConfigMaps, Secrets, RBAC
- **High Availability**: HPA, PodDisruptionBudgets, Rolling Updates
- **Security**: NetworkPolicies, RBAC, Security Contexts, Non-root containers
- **Monitoring**: ServiceMonitor for Prometheus, Health checks, Metrics
- **Supporting Services**: PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka (with Zookeeper), LocalStack

### 🌍 Environment Management
- **Development**: Optimized for local development with kind/minikube
- **Production**: Production-ready with high availability and security
- **Kustomize Overlays**: Environment-specific configurations

### 🤖 Automation Scripts
- **`deploy.sh`**: Complete deployment automation with build, test, deploy, and health checks
- **`setup-local-k8s.sh`**: Local Kubernetes cluster setup (kind/minikube)
- **`db-migrate.sh`**: Database migration and management operations

### 🛠️ Developer Experience
- **Makefile**: 40+ convenient commands for all operations
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed README with examples and troubleshooting
- **CI/CD Ready**: Scripts can be integrated into any CI/CD pipeline

## 🚀 Quick Start (5 minutes)

### 1. Prerequisites
```bash
# Install required tools (macOS)
brew install docker kubectl kind kustomize

# Or check if you have them
make help  # This will guide you through missing tools
```

### 2. One-Command Setup
```bash
# Complete development environment setup
make dev-full
```

This single command will:
- Start a local Kubernetes cluster
- Deploy all services (API, PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka, LocalStack)
- Run database migrations
- Set up monitoring and health checks

### 3. Access Your Service
Add to `/etc/hosts`:
```
127.0.0.1 dev.wal-service.local
```

Then access:
- **API**: http://dev.wal-service.local/api/v1
- **Health**: http://dev.wal-service.local/api/v1/health
- **Metrics**: http://dev.wal-service.local/api/v1/metrics

## 📖 Common Operations

### Daily Development
```bash
# Quick deployment (skip tests/build)
make dev-quick

# Check status
make dev-status

# View logs
make dev-logs

# Database operations
make db-migrate
make db-seed
```

### Debugging
```bash
# Port forward to service
make port-forward

# Get shell in pod
make shell

# Check events
make events

# Describe deployment
make describe
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
# Deploy to production
make prod-deploy

# Check production status
make prod-status

# Production database migration
make db-migrate-prod
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Development Environment
- **1 replica** with reduced resources
- **Debug logging** enabled
- **Local Docker registry** integration
- **No SSL/TLS** for simplicity
- **Fast iteration** with skip options

### Production Environment
- **5-20 replicas** with auto-scaling
- **High resource allocation**
- **SSL/TLS** with cert-manager integration
- **Production logging** and monitoring
- **Security hardening**

### Security Features
- **Network Policies**: Micro-segmentation between services
- **RBAC**: Minimal required permissions
- **Pod Security**: Non-root users, security contexts
- **Secrets Management**: Base64 encoded secrets (ready for external secret management)

### Monitoring & Observability
- **Prometheus ServiceMonitor**: Automatic metrics scraping
- **Health Checks**: Liveness, readiness, and startup probes
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Structured JSON logging in production
- **Resource Monitoring**: CPU, memory, and custom metrics

## 🔧 Customization

### Environment Variables
All configuration is managed through:
- **ConfigMaps**: Non-sensitive configuration
- **Secrets**: Sensitive data (passwords, API keys)
- **Environment-specific patches**: Override values per environment

### Scaling Configuration
```yaml
# Development: 1-3 replicas
# Production: 5-20 replicas
# CPU threshold: 70%
# Memory threshold: 80%
```

### Resource Allocation
```yaml
# Development: 128Mi RAM, 50m CPU
# Production: 512Mi RAM, 250m CPU
```

## 🚦 Production Readiness Checklist

- ✅ **High Availability**: Multi-replica deployment with auto-scaling
- ✅ **Security**: Network policies, RBAC, security contexts
- ✅ **Monitoring**: Health checks, metrics, logging
- ✅ **Disaster Recovery**: PodDisruptionBudgets, rolling updates
- ✅ **Configuration Management**: Environment-specific configurations
- ✅ **Database Management**: Migration scripts, backup strategies
- ✅ **CI/CD Integration**: Automated deployment scripts
- ✅ **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and examples
