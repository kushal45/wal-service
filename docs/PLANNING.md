kubectl port-forward -n wal-service-dev svc/wal-service 3000:3000 &
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/wal/write \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: test-api-key" \
  -d '{
    "namespace": "test-namespace",
    "payload": {"message": "Hello WAL"},
    "lifecycle": {"delay": 0}
  }'

# Check pod logs
kubectl logs -n wal-service-dev -l app=wal-service --tail=50
