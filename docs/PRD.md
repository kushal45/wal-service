## 1. Background & Motivation

Modern cloud-native architectures demand **strong durability, reliability, and flexibility** in handling data mutations, replication, retries, and recovery from failures. Netflix’s large-scale distributed platform adopted a generic Write-Ahead Log (WAL) abstraction to solve problems often encountered in production:

- Data loss and corruption
- Cross-datastore entropy
- Bulk mutation handling
- Reliable retry mechanisms
- Replication (regional/global)
- Mutation orchestration (multi-partition/multi-table)

The WAL pattern at Netflix addresses these, delivering pluggable reliability for databases, caches, queues, and service-oriented event delivery.

---

## 2. Objective

Build an MVP for a generic WAL service inspired by Netflix’s approach, providing a **clean API abstraction over underlying message queues (Kafka, SQS, etc.), pluggable durability, flexible orchestration, and support for delayed retries and cross-region replication**.

The MVP should enable onboarding with minimal configuration and expose foundational personas and use cases critical for distributed data platforms.

---

## 3. Scope

**In-Scope:**

- One main API (`WriteToLog`) encapsulating core WAL operations.
- Delayed Queues using SQS/Kafka.
- Cross-region replication for cache/storage (via configurable targets).
- Multi-mutation orchestration for eventual and guaranteed consistency.
- Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) support.
- Pluggable producer/consumer groups for performance scaling.
- Namespace and shard abstractions.
- Logical separation, configuration, and targeting.

**Out-of-Scope (MVP):**

- Advanced control panel/GUI.
- Real-time status dashboards.
- Non-critical operational metrics (to be added in full version).

---

## 4. User Personas & Use Cases

### Persona #1: Delayed Queues

- Services need to send mutations/events after a specified delay.
- WAL abstracts underlying queue delay, with jitter/backoff logic.
- Example: Bulk deletes in KV/caching delayed to flatten mutation curve, reducing impact on live traffic.

### Persona #2: Cross-Region Replication

- WAL mediates replication of events/mutations between regions for non-native replicated stores.
- Example: EVCache client writes/deletes replicated to all regions, preserving consistency with minimal app changes.

### Persona #3: Multi-Table (Multi-Partition) Mutations

- Orchestration of multiple puts/deletes spanning different tables, partitions, or storage backends.
- Eventual consistency, failsafe ordering, and chunked processing out of the box.

## 5. Functional Requirements

### 5.1 API Design

**Single Endpoint:**

- `WriteToLog(request: WriteToLogRequest): WriteToLogResponse`

**Request Parameters:**

- namespace: WAL configuration name
- lifecycle: delay, write time
- payload: mutation/event data
- target: destination details

**Response:**

- durable: {true | false | unknown}
- message: error/failure info

### 5.2 Namespace Configuration

Namespaces provide logical separation, controlling:

- Physical queue (Kafka, SQS, etc.)
- DLQ mapping
- Delay/backoff settings
- Maximum retries
- Target store/application

### 5.3 Shard & Scaling Model

- WAL service runs as shards (hardware clusters), each handling namespaces for isolation and scaling.
- Each namespace has dedicated resources for queueing; adding queues on the fly is possible.

### 5.4 DLQ (Dead Letter Queue) Support

- All mutations routed via WAL are safeguarded with DLQs.
- Operational flags to toggle WAL/DLQ handling.

### 5.5 Pluggable Architecture

- Producer/Consumer separation.
- PoC should allow easy replacement/swapping of underlying queue technology.

### 5.6 Target Flexibility

Target configuration via namespace. Supported:

- DBs (e.g., Cassandra)
- Caches (e.g., Memcached/EVCache)
- Queues (e.g., Kafka/SQS)
- Upstream services

---

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Scalability:** Horizontal scaling of producers/consumers per workload
- **Resilience:** Fault recovery, retry with configurable backoff
- **Availability:** Highly available via multi-shard, multi-region deployment
- **Extensibility:** Pluggable for future features (secondary indices, multi-target guarantees)
- **Operability:** Minimal initial configuration, metadata-driven setup

---

## 7. MVP Deliverables

- API Design & Documentation
- Namespace config loader/saver (JSON/YAML)
- Prototype for:
    - SQS-backed delayed queue namespace
    - Kafka-backed replication namespace
    - Multi-partition mutation support with at-least-once semantics
- Sharding & scaling model documentation
- Sample configuration files for 3 personas
- CI/CD integration scripts
- Basic test suite
- Deployment instructions

---

## 8. Risks & Tradeoffs

- Eventual consistency by default (not immediate consistency)
- Underlying queue limitations (delay, message size)
- Possible backpressure/latency in surge conditions
- At-least-once semantics leads to possible duplicates

---

## 9. Future Directions

- Secondary indices using WAL
- Multi-datastore atomic delivery
- Advanced configuration and observability
- Real-time monitoring and tracing dashboards

---

## 10. References & Acknowledgements

This design is inspired by Netflix’s “Building a Resilient Data Platform with Write-Ahead Log” architecture.
